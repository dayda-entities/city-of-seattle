This data set shows the CLASS PreK assessment scores for Seattle Preschool Program (SPP) classrooms overtime, compared to two benchmark programs: Head Start or Early Achievers and SPP's overall goal. The SPP scores only include non-Family Child Care providers.

The CLASS PreK is an assessment tool used to rate classroom practices in preschool by measuring the interactions between children and adults. It is one of the assessments that contribute to a provider agency’s Early Achievers rating. CLASS is widely used in Pre-K classrooms as it describes multiple dimensions of teaching that are linked to student achievement and development, and it has been validated in over 2,000 classrooms. 

The teaching practices assessed are grouped into three domains: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization and Instructional Support. CLASS uses a 7-point rating scale. A score of 1 or 2 indicates low range quality; a score of 6 or 7 indicates high-quality.
