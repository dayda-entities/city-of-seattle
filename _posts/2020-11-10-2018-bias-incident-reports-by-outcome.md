The Seattle Office for Civil Rights (SOCR) receives calls on the Bias Incident Reporting Line. This dataset shows the amount of calls received each quarter of 2018 by outcome. An “uncategorized” outcome means the call did not fall into one of the listed categories or SOCR was unable to complete the communication with the caller.
