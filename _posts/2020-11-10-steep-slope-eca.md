<div>A polygon feature class showing areas with an incline of 40% or more (10 feet of vertical rise over a horizontal distance of 25 feet or less) with a height of at least 10 feet. </div><div>This layer was produced using a combination of 2001 LIDAR contours (Puget Sound LIDAR Consortium) and the 1993 topographic contours from aerial photos. The Steep Slope layer was most recently updated under SDCI Director's Rule 12-2019 <br /><a href='https://www.seattle.gov/dpd/codes/dr/DR2019-12.pdf' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>https://www.seattle.gov/dpd/codes/dr/DR2019-12.pdf</a>  </div><div> </div><div>The steep slope area map is called “advisory” because the mapping is used by the Seattle Department of Construction and Inspections for initial information and screening. Whether or not a site is eventually treated as an environmentally critical area is based on the actual topography of the ground surface.</div><div> </div><div>For more information about the definition of steep slope erosion hazard areas, see Seattle Municipal Code section 25.09.012, environmentally critical areas definitions. <br /><a href='https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.09REENCRAR ' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.09REENCRAR</a> </div><div><span><br /></span></div><div><div>Because of the size of this dataset, we do not recommend trying to download it.
