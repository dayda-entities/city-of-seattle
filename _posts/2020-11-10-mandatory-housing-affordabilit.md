<p>For properties subject to Mandatory Housing Affordability, the fee areas map specifies the locational dimension of the MHA requirement.  </p><p>Mandatory Housing Affordability requires new development to contribute to affordable housing by including affordable housing in the development or making a payment to the City’s Office of Housing to support affordable housing. The amount of the MHA contribution varies based on a property’s location and other factors specified in Seattle Municipal Code Chapters 23.58B and 23.58C.  For properties subject to MHA, the fee areas map specifies the locational dimension of the MHA requirement.  MHA amounts in Downtown and South Lake Union have specific requirement levels for each zone as listed in SMC 23.58B and 23.58C. For other areas, the relative high, medium or low aspect of the MHA requirement corresponds to market strength area of the city.  </p>
