A census block is the smallest geographic unit used by the United States Census Bureau for tabulation of 100-percent data (data collected from all houses, rather than a sample of houses). 

Census blocks are grouped into block groups, which are grouped into census tracts. There are on average about 39 blocks per block group. Blocks typically have a four-digit number; the first number indicates which block group the block is in. For example, census block 3019 would be in block group 3.

Blocks are typically bounded by streets, roads or creeks. In cities, a census block may correspond to a city block, but in rural areas where there are fewer roads, blocks may be limited by other features.
