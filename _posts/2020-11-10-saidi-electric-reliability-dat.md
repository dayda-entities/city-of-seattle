Monthly System Average Interruption Duration Index, or SAIDI, is a reliability indicator used by electric power utilities. It is the average outage duration, in minutes, experienced by each customer served. SAIDI is calculated as the sum of all customer interruption durations for each month divided by the total number of customers served during that month.
