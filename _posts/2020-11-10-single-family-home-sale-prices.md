Displacement risk indicator classifying census tracts according to 
single-family home sale prices. Each census tract where at least 100 
single-family homes were sold in arms-length transactions are classified
 along two dimensions:<br /><ol><li>The average price of sales within the 
census tract for the specified year, balancing between nominal sale 
price and sale price per square foot.</li><li>The change in average sale price (again balanced between nominal sale price and price per square foot) from the previous year.</li></ol>
