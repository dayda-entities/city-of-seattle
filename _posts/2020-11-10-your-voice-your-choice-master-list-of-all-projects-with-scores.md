This is a list of street or park improvement ideas submitted by community members as a part of the Your Voice, Your Choice: Parks and Streets participatory budgeting program. These ideas were reviewed for feasibility by Seattle Parks and Recreation and Seattle Department of Transportation and prioritized by project development teams made up of community members. Ideas identified as both feasible and high-priority appeared on ballots by council district in June, and 33 projects were approved by voters to be included in the Mayorâ€™s 2018 proposed budget. This list includes final project status for each idea submitted in 2017.
