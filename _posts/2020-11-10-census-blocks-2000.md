A census block is the smallest geographic unit used by the 
United States Census Bureau for tabulation of 100-percent data (data 
collected from all houses, rather than a sample of houses). Census 
blocks are grouped into block groups, which are grouped into census 
tracts. There are on average about 39 blocks per block group. Blocks 
typically have a four-digit number; the first number indicates which 
block group the block is in. For example, census block 3019 would be in 
block group 3.
Blocks are typically bounded by streets, roads or creeks. In cities, a 
census block may correspond to a city block, but in rural areas where 
there are fewer roads, blocks may be limited by other features.
