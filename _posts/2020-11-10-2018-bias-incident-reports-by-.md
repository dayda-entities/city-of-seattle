The Seattle Office for Civil Rights (SOCR) receives calls on the Bias Incident Reporting Line. This dataset shows the amount of calls received each quarter of 2018 by protected class. A protected class is a characteristic of a person that is protected by the laws SOCR enforces such as race, gender identity, or disability. An “uncategorized” protected class means the caller did not provide a protected class.
