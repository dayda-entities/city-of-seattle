Records of Seattle Fire Department (SFD) permits related to decommissioning of a residential heating oil tank, permit code 6103.  A record with incomplete tank info indicates that the required follow-up report has not been received by SFD.  Please note that SFD records begin in 1996 when state requirement was introduced.  Decommissioning of a residential heating oil tank might have occurred prior to 1996, in which SFD will not have a record.
Commercial UST records can be requested through City Public Records Request Center at http://www.seattle.gov/public-records/public-records-request-center
