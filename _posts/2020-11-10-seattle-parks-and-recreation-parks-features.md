Listing of all park features by park.  EX: if a park has multiple tennis courts each of them is included.

PMAID is our Property Management Area ID. It is used by the City of Seattle to reference a group of adjoined land parcels into a larger area such as a park. This coding works well for Parks because most parks consist of multiple parcels. This number is assigned by the city. Other cities likely use a similar identifier, but not the same method as Seattle.
