<div><p>No two neighborhoods in Seattle are the same. The Micro Community 
Policing Plans (MCPP) were designed to address the distinctive needs of 
each community.   The plans take a three prong approach that brings 
community engagement, crime data and police services together to get 
direct feedback on perceptions of crime and public safety. MCPP are 
tailored to meet the individual needs of each community, with a unique 
approach owned by the community.</p>
<strong>Why are Perceptions of Crime Important?</strong>
<p>Citizen perceptions of crime and public safety matter. When used in 
conjunction with crime data, citizen perceptions at the micro-community 
level provide a more accurate picture of the reality of crime and public
 safety than can be seen through crime statistics alone.   This is what 
makes the MCPP strategy unique. </p>
<strong>How were the Neighborhoods Defined?</strong>
The MCPP neighborhoods were defined through police-citizen engagement
 including community meetings, focus groups, survey data, and the 
realities of geographic boundaries SPD can use to collect and report on 
events. The MCPPs and their neighborhoods will be routinely reevaluated 
with attention to the ways in which citizens who live in Seattle 
neighborhoods define their communities. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>https://www.seattle.gov/police/community-policing/mcpp</div>
