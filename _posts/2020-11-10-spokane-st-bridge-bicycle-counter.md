The Spokane Bridge Bicycle Counter records the number of bikes that cross the bridge using the pedestrian/bicycle pathway on the south side. Inductive loops on the pathway count the passing of bicycles with travel direction. The data consists of a date/time field, east pathway count field and west pathway count field. The count fields represent the total bicycles detected during the specified one hour period.
