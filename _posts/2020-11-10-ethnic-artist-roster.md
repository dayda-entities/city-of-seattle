The Ethnic Artist Roster is a diverse list of artists of color who were selected through a panel process for exhibition opportunities in city owned or affiliated galleries. This roster is a resource to anyone who is looking for artwork by artists of color or who wants to host a culturally relevant art exhibition. The Ethnic Artist Roster is managed by the Seattle Office of Arts & Culture.
