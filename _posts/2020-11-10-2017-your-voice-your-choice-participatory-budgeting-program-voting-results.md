This is a list of all street or park improvement ideas that appeared on the June 2017 Your Voice, Your Choice: Parks and Streets participatory budgeting ballot. The list indicates which projects were funded, whether they will be implemented by Seattle Department of Transportation or Seattle Parks and Recreation, the cost of each project, and how many total, online and paper votes were received for each project. The funded projects will be included in the Mayorâ€™s 2018 proposed budget, and work will begin in 2018.
