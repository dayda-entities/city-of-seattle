Seattle Votes is a community outreach and engagement campaign to identify and better document the barriers to civic engagement for Seattle's immigrant and refugee residents. By partnering with hundreds of organizations, thousands of Seattle-King County immigrants and refugees will have a chance to tell us why they don't become citizens, register to vote, or vote. NOTE: Due to the methodology of the campaign, this data is not a random sample.
