These sensors counts both people riding bikes and pedestrians. Separate volumes are tallied for each travel mode. Wires in a diamond formation in the concrete detect bikes and an infrared sensor mounted on a wooden post detects pedestrians. The counters also capture the direction of travel for both bikes and pedestrians.

The temporary counter data from 5/10/2013 to 12/11/2013 have been combined to this data set which counted only bikes and not pedestrians.
