Monthly System Average Interruption Frequency Index, or SAIFI, is a reliability indicator used by electric power utilities. It represents the average number of sustained service interruptions a customer would experience, and is calculated as the total number of customer interruptions divided by the total number of customers served. A sustained service interruption is defined as two or more minutes.
