<div><b> </b> Census Tracts are small, relatively permanent statistical 
subdivisions of a county or equivalent entity that are updated by local 
participants prior to each decennial census as part of the Census 
Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program. The Census Bureau 
delineates census tracts in situations where no local participant 
existed or where state, local, or tribal governments declined to 
participate. The primary purpose of census tracts is to provide a stable
 set of geographic units for the presentation of statistical data.
Census tracts generally have a population size between 1,200 and 8,000 
people, with an optimum size of 4,000 people. A census tract usually 
covers a contiguous area; however, the spatial size of census tracts 
varies widely depending on the density of settlement. Census tract 
boundaries are delineated with the intention of being maintained over a 
long time so that statistical comparisons can be made from census to 
census. Census tracts occasionally are split due to population growth or
 merged as a result of substantial population decline. <br /></div>
