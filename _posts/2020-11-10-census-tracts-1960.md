This boundary file contains historic census tract boundaries for which the U.S. Census Bureau tabulated data and was produced by the Minnesota Population Center as part of the National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) project. The NHGIS is an National Science Foundation-sponsored project (Grant No. BCS0094908) to create a digital spatial-temporal database of all available historical US aggregate census materials. The available shapefiles on the NHGIS site represent version 1.0 of historical US census tract boundary files for the 1910-2000 censuses. These electronic census tract boundary files were created by referencing publicly available, printed U.S. Census Bureau maps and considerable care was taken during their production. TIGER/Line spatial features that corresponded to boundaries on these maps were used to construct proper historic boundaries. When a TIGER/Line features was not available, we digitized the historic boundary from a geo-referenced, scanned census map. The boundary files have been checked against currently available historical census aggregate data.
