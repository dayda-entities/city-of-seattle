<span style='line-height: 107%; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;'><font size='3'>Routes or route pairs
providing frequent transit service are determined through a count of trips per
hour across time periods as defined in SMC 23.84A.038. Stops serving these
routes/route pairs (or the frequent/overlapping segments of routes) are
selected, and a Â¼ mile walkshed based on the street network is calculated. All
parcels with at least one lot line touching this walkshed are considered to be
within the parking flexibility area, and are eligible for parking reduction
(dependent on other regulatory factors, such as zoning).</font></span>
