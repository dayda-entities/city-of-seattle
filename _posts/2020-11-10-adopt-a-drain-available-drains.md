Adopt-a-Drain
Maintaining Storm Drains:
<div><p>Join volunteers across the city to maintain storm drains, a critical part of our utility infrastructure.</p>
<p><a href='http://www.seattle.gov/util/EnvironmentConservation/GetInvolved/AdoptaDrain/Adopt-a-DrainSignup/index.htm' target=''>Sign up to adopt a storm drain</a> near your home or work. By registering, you commit to keeping the drain surface clear of leaves and other debris year round.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact us at <a href='mailto:adoptadrain@seattle.gov' target=''>adoptadrain@seattle.gov</a> or at (206) 233-7187.</p>
Why should I adopt a drain?
<ul><li>Prevent flooding in your neighborhood by keeping drains free of debris.</li><li>Prevent pollutants from entering streams, creeks and Puget Sound, which protects fish and other wildlife.</li><li>Help the city maintain our infrastructure, especially during fall months when rain increases and falling leaves block drains.</li></ul>
<p>If you adopt a drain, SPU may contact you to notify you of anticipated storms and flood events.</p>http://www.seattle.gov/util/environmentconservation/getinvolved/adoptadrain/</div>
