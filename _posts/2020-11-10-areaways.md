Areaways are spaces that exist under sidewalks and between the street and the adjacent building. Although there are a variety of reasons why areaways exist around Seattle, the most common case is the reconstruction and raising of street grades in the Pioneer Square area following the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. The city built street walls and filled the street area from the 1890s through the 1940s. <br /><br />| Attribute Information: <a href='https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/GIS/Areaways_OD.pdf' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/GIS/Areaways_OD.pdf</a> <br /><br />| Data Confidence: Low <br />| Data Confidence Source: <a href='https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/About/SDOT2015SCReportFinal12-7-2015.pdf' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>2015 SDOT Asset Management, Status and Condition Report</a> <br /><br />| Update Cycle: Weekly  <br />| Contact Email: <a href='mailto:DOT_IT_GIS@seattle.gov' rel='nofollow ugc' target='_blank'>DOT_IT_GIS@seattle.gov</a>
