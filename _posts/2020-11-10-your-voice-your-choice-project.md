A program of Seattle Department of Neighborhoods, this is a list of street or park improvement ideas submitted by community members as a part of Your Voice Your Choice Participatory Budgeting. Ideas were vetted by project development teams made up of community members who volunteered to evaluate each project. Seattle Parks and Recreation and Seattle Department of Transportation also reviewed the projects for feasibility. The results and evaluation, along with location are provided in the set. The list will be finalized and ready for the community to vote (by council district) beginning June 3.
