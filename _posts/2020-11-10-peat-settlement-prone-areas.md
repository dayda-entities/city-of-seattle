Peat settlement-prone areas. Peat settlement-prone areas consist of Category I and
                  Category II peat settlement-prone areas that are delineated on Maps A1 through A26,
                  Peat Settlement-prone Area Boundaries Maps, codified at the end of this<a href='https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.09REENCRAR'><span></span> Chapter 25.09</a>. This parcel-specific delineation is based on the location of the relevant bog or
                  bogs identified in City of Seattle Identified Bogs (Troost 2007) plus a buffer of
                  50 feet for Category I peat settlement-prone areas or a buffer of 25 feet for Category
                  II peat settlement-prone areas. On parcels larger than 50,000 square feet, the Director
                  may consider a parcel-specific delineation, provided by the applicant, of the peat
                  settlement-prone area boundary on a parcel. Where a parcel-specific delineation conflicts
                  with the Peat Settlement-prone Area Boundaries Maps, the parcel-specific delineation
                  shall apply.
