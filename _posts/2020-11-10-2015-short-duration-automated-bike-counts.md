SDOT used Eco-Counter automated pneumatic tube counters to count cyclist volumes across the city. Most counts are for six days, but some may be longer or shorter. This is the raw data from counts conducted during 2015.

Counts are for both directions (when a street is not one way) unless specified in the Location Field.
SB = Southbound
NB = Northbound
EB = Eastbound
WB = Westbound
