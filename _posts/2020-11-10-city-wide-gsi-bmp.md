If BMP level data are available, each point represents one type of GSI feature with the count by project. There may be many points for one project, each plotted on top of one another. If BMP data are not available such as the SDCI data, there will be point for each project.</div><div style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'><br /></div><div style='font-family: &quot;Avenir Next W01&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next W00&quot;, &quot;Avenir Next&quot;, Avenir, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>This grouped layerfile displays City-wide Green Stormwater Infrastructure Best Management Practices(City-wide GSI BMP) and City-wide Green Stormwater Infrastructure projects(City-wide GSI Project).  GSI BMP is sourced from CARTO.GSI_BMP_PT_PV.  Labels are based on the attribute BMP.  City-wide GSI Project displays the data from CARTO.GSI_PT_PV.   The labels are based on the attribute PROJECT NAME.  This data will not display when zoomed out beyond 1:3,000.Seattle Executive Order 2013-01 and City Council Resolution 31459 direct City departments to coordinate to develop an implementation strategy for managing 700 million gallons of stormwater annually with green stormwater infrastructure approaches by 2025.  These data on the location, purpose, funder, install year, and best managed practices of GSI installations in Seattle are gathered and integrated for comprehensive City-wide tracking and reporting at the project level.</div>
