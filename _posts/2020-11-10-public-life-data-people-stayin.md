------------------------------------------

The City of Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) is providing data from the public life studies it has conducted since 2017. These studies consist of measuring the number of people using public space and the types of activities present on select sidewalks across the city, as well as several parks and plazas. The data set is continually updated as SDOT and other parties conduct public life studies using Gehl Instituteâ€™s Public Life Data Protocol.

This dataset consists of four component spreadsheets and a GeoJSON file, which provide public life data as well as information about the study design and study locations:

1 Public Life Study: provides details on the different studies that have been conducted, including project information.
