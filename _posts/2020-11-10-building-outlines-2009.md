In the downtown area, building outlines will either be modified versions of the 2005 outlines or created directly from 2009 imagery. Due to the height of the buildings in the downtown region, building lean in the tiles will make it difficult to create accurate building outlines. The accuracy of the building outlines in the downtown area cannot be guaranteed.</div></span><br /></div>
