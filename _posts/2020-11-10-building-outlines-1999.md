<span>  <div>Building Outlines Derived From 1999 Digital Orthophotos. Delineates building rooflines. Data tables contain peak elevations &amp; building type. The 1999 Bldg data includes the existing buildings from the original 1993 data plus new construction since 1993. Also, demolished buildings were removed from the data, and other changes to buildings, such as additions or partial demolition were reflected.  NOTE: All buildings that were not added or updated by Triathlon are directly from the 1993 Building data. Therefore most of the 1999 attribute data is actually exactly the same as the 1993 attribute data, including erroneous data. The vendor was not responsible for checking or correcting attribute data associated with existing buildings unless the building vectors required changes. For example, the 1993 orthophotography quality was quite poor in many areas and many buildings were coded as OBS because their outlines were simply not visible enough. With the 1999 orthophotography we now able to clearly make out most details that were not evident in the 1993 orthophotography. So you will see many buildings in the 1999 data coded as OBS that are clearly not obscured.  The poor quality of the 1993 orthophotography also interferes with sorting out the updated buildings from the old existing bldgs because many of the 1993 bldgs were not put in quite right due to the fuzzy 1993 ortho quality. Many of these existing bldgs ended up being &quot;updated&quot; by Triathlon.</div></span><br />
