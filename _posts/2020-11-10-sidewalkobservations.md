This dataset is an enumeration of the features that occur along the length of a sidewalk that may impede accessibility and/or indicate wear or damage to the structure of the sidewalk. These include height differences (uplifts and faulting), surface conditions (like cracking and moss), and obstructions. Street furnishings (benches, rails, curb bulbs) are a fourth category of feature collected by data collectors.<div><br /><div>This dataset <b>was published in the fall of 2017</b>; we plan to update this data in the winter of 2020.<br /></div><div><br />Relationship: One-to-many with sidewalks as the parent using Sidewalk UNITID as the primary and foreign key.<br /><br />Website:Â <a href='https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/about-sdot/asset-management/sidewalk-condition-assessment-project' target='_blank'>https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/about-sdot/asset-management/sidewalk-condition-assessment-project</a></div></div>
