This dataset includes what has consistently proven to be the top seven Service Requests the City received during the last 12 months. Six are specific (non-General Inquiry) types of Service Requests (Abandoned Vehicle, Illegal Dumping Report, Pothole, Graffiti Report, Parking Enforcement and Sign and Signal Maintenance) and the seventh, CSB-General Inquiry, represents requests for a variety of services received by the Customer Service Bureau, which are then assigned to departments accordingly.
