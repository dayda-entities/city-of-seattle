This dataset shows what percent of Seattle Preschool Program (SPP) participants in 17-18 and 18-19 met or exceeded widely held expectations (WHE) for their age group in all 6 Teaching Strategies Gold (TSG) domains. It also show's their average number of domains in which they met or exceeded WHE. The data is aggregated by race/ethnicity, primary language and family income level.

The State’s kindergarten readiness assessment, WaKIDS is based on Teaching Strategies GOLD® (TSG). Preschool children who meet age-level expectations in each area are on track toward kindergarten readiness. TSG is an observational assessment completed by children’s teachers in the course of their daily work. “Widely Held Expectations” are the expected skills for each domain, based on the child's age. Children are assessed by teachers in six domains: Social-Emotional (emotional regulation, positive relationships, cooperation), Physical (gross and fine motor strength, coordination), Language (speaking, understanding), Cognitive (remembering experiences, classification skills, symbolic thinking), Literacy (sound awareness, alphabet knowledge, emergent reading/writing), and Mathematics (counting, shapes).
