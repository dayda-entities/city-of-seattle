<p>Seattle is divided into five geographic areas. Within those areas are
 the 5 precincts or police stations: North, East, South, West and 
Southwest. Precinct boundaries were determined through consideration of 
neighborhood boundaries, geographic and other natural boundaries.</p>
<p>Each precinct contains smaller geographic areas called Sectors. There are 17 sectors total in the city.</p>
<p>Each of these Sectors are divided into between 3 smaller sections 
called Beats (i.e. Ocean sector has three beats O1, O2, O3) These are 
the areas that individual patrol officers are assigned responsibility 
for.</p>
