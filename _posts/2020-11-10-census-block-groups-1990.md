Block Groups (BGs) are statistical divisions of census tracts, are generally defined to contain between 600 and 3,000 people, and are used to present data and control block numbering.  A block group consists of clusters of blocks within the same census tract that have the same first digit of their four-digit census block number.  For example, blocks 3001, 3002, 3003, . . ., 3999 in census tract 1210.02 belong to BG 3 in that census tract.  Most BGs were delineated by local participants in the Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program.  The Census Bureau delineated BGs only where a local or tribal government declined to participate, and a regional organization or State Data Center was not available to participate.
