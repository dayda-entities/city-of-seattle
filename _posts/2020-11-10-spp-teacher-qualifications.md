This dataset shows the number of lead Seattle Preschool Program (SPP) teachers who did not meet, met or exceeded SPP's benchmark teacher qualification (a bachelor's degree in early childhood education). A few teachers did not have data entered. The dataset does not include Family Child Care teachers. Recognizing that this was a new requirement for the early learning community, the city gives lead teachers up to four years after their SPP start date to achieve this standard. Those who have not yet earned a bachelorâ€™s degree are eligible for the SPP Scholars Tuition Support Program.
