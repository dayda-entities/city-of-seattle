This table shows all active disciplinary appeals for Seattle Police officers. The Seattle City Attorney's Office Employment Section handles all employee appeals of discipline and shares status updates with OPA. 

Multiple rows with the same OPA case number indicate more than one officer has appealed discipline for that case.
