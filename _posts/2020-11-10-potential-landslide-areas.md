<div><span><div>A polygon feature class showing potential landslide areas. Used to implement and regulate the City of Seattle's Environmentally Critical Areas policies. Last updated in 2001 via the Seattle Landslide Study.  The original data was created from City of Seattle State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) maps which table digitized in 1995 by Donald Tubbs. Shannon &amp; Wilson added runoff zones &amp; edge smoothing.</div><div><div><div style='text-align:Left;'><div><div><p><span>Areas
 with indications of past landslide activity, such as landslide 
headscarps and sidescarps, hummocky terrain, areas with geologic 
conditions that can promote earth movement, and areas with signs of 
potential landsliding, such as springs, groundwater seepage, and bowed 
or backtilted trees. See code section number 25.09.020 of the Seattle 
Municipal Code for a more complete definition of environmentally 
critical areas: </span><span>https://library.municode.com/wa/seattle/codes/municipal_code?nodeId=TIT25ENPRHIPR_CH25.09REENCRAR</span></p></div></div></div></div></div></span></div>
