This dataset compares the demographics of the Seattle Preschool Program (SPP)'s 4 year-olds to those of Seattle Public Schools (SPS)'s kindergarteners. SPS kindergarteners represent the approximate pool of potential SPP enrollees, so the user can reflect on how SPP's enrollees are the same or different from SPS's population.
