<p style='line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt'><span style='font-family: '><font face='Verdana'><font size='2'><font color='#000000'>The Street Network Database (SND) is a representation of the physical, land based, improved, travel pathway infrastructure and associated theoretical address ranges. The pathway representation consists of Segments and Intersection elements. A Segment is a linear graphic element that represents a continuous physical travel path terminated by path end (dead end) or physical intersection with other travel paths. Segments have one street name, one address range and one set of segment characteristics. A Segment may have none or multiple alias street names. Segment types included are Freeways, Highways, Streets, Alleys (named only), Railroads, Walkways, and Bike lanes. SNDSEG is a linear feature class representing the SND Segment Feature, with attributes for Street name, Address Range, Alias Street name and segment Characteristics objects. Part of the Address Range and all of Street name objects are logically shared with the Discrete Address Point-Master Address File layer. </font></font></font></span></p>
