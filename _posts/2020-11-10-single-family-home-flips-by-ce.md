Displacement risk indicator showing the number of property transactions of single-family homes recorded by the King County Assessor that can be classified as
 &quot;flips&quot; (meaning that the home had previously been sold within the past
 year and that the sale price had increased between sales at least twice
 as fast as the increase in regional housing Consumer Price Index during
 the same time period). Summarized at the census tract level; available for every year from 2004 through the 
most recent year of 
available data.
