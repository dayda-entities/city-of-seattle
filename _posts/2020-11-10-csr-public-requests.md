This dataset shows the customer service requests, by Request Type, Department received, Neighborhood, received in the Customer Service Request (CSR) system since 1/1/2017.
Data is refreshed at the beginning of each quarter. The CSR system is not a citywide CRM system.  City departments receive and respond to customer service requests in many different ways.  This data is a small subset of the requests received through CSR.
