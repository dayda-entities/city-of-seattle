Cases result in settlement in a variety of ways. A pre-determination settlement occurs at any point during the investigation. A conciliation occurs after a reasonable cause finding is issued. At times, parties settle privately which results in a withdrawal with benefits. This dataset shows the amount of cases that settle by month at the Seattle Office for Civil Rights for all categories noted above.
