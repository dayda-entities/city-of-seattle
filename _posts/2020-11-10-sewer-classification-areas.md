<div style='text-align:Left;'><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span><span>The classification of SPU infrastructure in the City of Seattle and the former service area north of the City limits into areas of piped flow where storm water flow is either separated, partially separated, or combined with sanitary flow.  </span></span><span>An area with separated flow means that drainage flow is in drainage pipes only.  A partially separated area means that some pipes are present that have both drainage and sanitary flow.  A combined area has all pipes carrying sanitary and drainage flow.</span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span><br /></span></p><p style='margin:0 0 0 0;'><span>Data source is SEWER_CLASS_AREA_PLGN.  Symbology is based on the attribute SCA_CLASS_CODE.  Labels are also based on that attribute and do not display when zoomed out beyond 1:50,000.  This layerfile does not display when zoomed out beyond 1:200,000.  Data not currently maintained.  <br /></span></p><div><p><span></span></p></div></div>
