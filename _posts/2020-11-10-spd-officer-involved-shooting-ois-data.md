Records of Officer Involved Shootings (OIS) from 2005 to the present, including a brief narrative synopsis. Data set does not contain records from active investigations. Data is visualized in a dashboard on the SPD public site (https://www.seattle.gov/police/information-and-data/use-of-force-data/officer-involved-shootings-dashboard), please reference as a guide for use. Dashboard is available for download.  

Until 2017, the Seattle Police Department had been updating these data as cases completed the inquest and other external processes. Given the current delay in the those systems, SPD is now going to post updates when the Force Review Board has determined if the action(s) was within policy. 

Use of force data also available here: https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/Use-Of-Force/ppi5-g2bj and is updated daily. Data includes Type III - OIS.
