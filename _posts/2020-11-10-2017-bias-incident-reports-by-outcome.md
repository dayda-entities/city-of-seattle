The Seattle Office for Civil Rights (SOCR) receives calls on the Bias Incident Reporting Line. Calls are received by front desk staff and logged. This dataset shows the amount of calls received each quarter of 2017 by outcome. An “uncategorized” outcome means the call did not fall into one of the listed categories or SOCR was unable to complete the communication with the caller. 

If you have questions about this data or want to learn more about the laws SOCR enforces, call 206-684-4500 or visit http://www.seattle.gov/civilrights.
